# Project 2: Proposal

## Team C

***Project's high-level goal:*** Our group aims to create **an** **interactive 3D digital sphere model**, which simulates the global map, to illustrate changes in precipitation, temperature, and other weather factors in the last 10 years ( including the current moment) / the near-predicted future.

## 1. Motivation

-   Recently, due to the irregular changes in global climate, there have been several unexpected disasters/ weather phenomena in many areas in the world. For instance, the storm that led to the flood in Dubai or the heavy rain caused significant damage to public infrastructures in some Red River Delta provinces ( Hanoi, Hung Yen, Bac Ninh) last week. Therefore, we believe that a map illustrating the weather state in desired locations which allows people to see previous behaviors of the weather and give them some predictions is necessary.  

## 2. Project description

### 2.1 Requirements

-   Countries/ areas on the globe would be colored based on their level of weather factors ( precipitation, temperature, humidity, rain probability, etc.). Users should be allowed to roll the model or zoom it in/out to investigate data of their interested area. We aim to make the map as specific as we can, however, the initial goal, which is based on our current available dataset, is to make it still separatable at the province/ city level. 

-   Besides data visualization, simple data mining techniques might also be applied to give predictions of future weather phenomena.

### 2.2 Dataset Description

## 3. Project contribution

-   Our project will contribute to:

    -   **Save the time of searching for weather information**: By collecting and synthesizing weather data from different sources to create a unified map illustrating information on a global scale, users can find weather information everywhere just by visiting our platform instead of collecting insight about different areas from multiple sources 

    -   **Visualize prediction of extreme weather events**: This project will use color mapping to visualize the predicted data produced by our model. The visualization might intuitively show, for example, the directions, intensities, or durations of storms one or 2 weeks before they come. This improvement has a better impact compared to numerical data

    -   **Delivery the up-to-date information ( nice-to-have feature)**: Our project will provide weather information in at most 5 hours of latency, therefore, users can access the information whenever they want instead of waiting for the “weather forecast” program/ posts on the media platform. However, this improvement requires a high-quality data set, which we haven’t found.

**Agile methodology:** The agile methodology will be used for the overall development process. This means that the project will be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and each task will be tested and revised as needed. This will help to ensure that the chatbot is developed on time and within budget.  ![Task 0](image1.png){width="814"}

**Milestones:** we have allocated each of the milestones as a goal for each sprint. Specifically, we have 6 main sprints with each a specific increment in details, noted in the deliverable with further details can be found below. ![Task 0](image2.png){width="814"} ![Task 0](image3.png){width="814"} ![Task 0](image4.png){width="814"}
